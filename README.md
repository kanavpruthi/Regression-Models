# Regression-Models

Basic ML models on Linear, Multivariate regressions and Gradient Descent.

The model on Multivariate regression predicts house prices based on a given large data sheet.
The model on Linear Regression predicts the amount of revenue a movie generates based on the capital investment in it, based on a large data set of movies from the last decade.
The Gradient Descent model plainly implements some basic cost functions and their derivatives, graphically and also plots multivariate cost functions by 3D graph data visualisation.
